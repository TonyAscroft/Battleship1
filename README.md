# Battleship1
<img src="https://github.com/TonyAscroft/Battleship1/edit/master/images/title.jpg>
This is a Battleship game I created as a project to help learn JavaScript from step by step instructions in "Head First JavaScript Programming". <br> <br>
What I did-
  <ul>
  <li>Step by step creation of the app. </li>
  <li>Being an artist and designer I upgraded the image files.</li>
  <li>Published on Github and linked 'to' from my personal website <a href="http://tonyascroft.ca/" target="_blank">TonyAscroft.ca</a> </li>
  </ul>
