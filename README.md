# Battleship1
This is a Battleship game I created as a project to help learn JavaScript from step by step instructions in "Head First JavaScript Programming". <br> <br>
What I did-
  <ul>
  <li>Step by step creation of the app. </li>
  <li>Being an artist and designer I upgraded the default image files.</li>
  <li>Published on Github and linked 'to' from my personal website <a href="http://tonyascroft.ca/" target= "_blank">TonyAscroft.ca</a> </li>
  </ul>
